# Mini Projects in Medical Image Reconstruction and Processing 

These mini project assignments were solved for the EEE 475 Medical Image Reconstruction and Proecssing course at Bilkent University during Spring Semester 2019. The assignments were implemented in MATLAB. For more detailed information, you can check the assignment files, MATLAB scripts, and solution reports.

## Homework #1
- Task: Partial k-space reconstruction with Phase-Corrected Conjugate Synthesis (PCCS) method, Homodyne reconstruction method, and POCS algorithm. Performance analysis with quantitative analysis with PSNR and SSIM, and qualitative analysis with error images. 
- Relavant Topics: MRI image reconstruction, k-space spectrum, 2D Fourier transform, image quality assesments (IQA) e.g. PSNR and SSIM.
