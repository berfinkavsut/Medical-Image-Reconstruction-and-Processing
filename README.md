# Mini Projects in Medical Image Reconstruction and Processing 

These mini-project assignments were solved for the EEE 475 Medical Image Reconstruction and Processing course at Bilkent University during the Spring Semester 2019. The assignments were implemented in MATLAB. For more detailed information, you can check the assignment files, MATLAB scripts, and solution reports.

## Homework #1
  **Tasks:** 
- Partial k-space reconstruction in MRI with Phase-Corrected Conjugate Synthesis (PCCS) method, Homodyne reconstruction method, and POCS algorithm. 
- Performance analysis with quantitative analysis with PSNR and SSIM, and qualitative analysis with error images. 
- Image quality assessments (IQA) e.g. PSNR and SSIM.

## Homework #2
  **Tasks:** 
- Gridding of spiral k-space data by calculating density compensation filter, which is found with the Voronoidens method.
- Direct summation method
- Gridding of radial data
