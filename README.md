# Mini Projects in Medical Image Reconstruction and Processing 

These mini project assignments were solved for the EEE 475 Medical Image Reconstruction and Proecssing course at Bilkent University during Spring Semester 2019. The assignments were implemented in MATLAB. For more detailed information, you can check the assignment files, MATLAB scripts, and solution reports.

## Homework #1
**Tasks:** 
- Partial k-space reconstruction in MRI with Phase-Corrected Conjugate Synthesis (PCCS) method, Homodyne reconstruction method, and POCS algorithm. 
- Performance analysis with quantitative analysis with PSNR and SSIM, and qualitative analysis with error images. 
**Additional Topics:** 
- k-space spectrum
- 2D Fourier transform
- image quality assesments (IQA) e.g. PSNR and SSIM.

## Homework #2
- **Tasks:** Gridding of spiral k-space data by calculating density compensation filter, which is found with Voronoidens method; direct summation method; gridding of radial data. Backprojection with naive backprojection and the Projection Slice Theorem. 

## Homework #3
- **Tasks:** System matrix reconstruction for Magnetic Partical Imaging (MPI), reconstruction via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), truncated SVD, filtered SVD,  Kaczmarz method with/without regularization, image reconstruction with real MPI data. 

- **Additional Topics:** Preparing system matrix and measurement vector, row norm thresholding, choosing parameter of filtered SVD via L-curve analysis.

## Homework #4
- **Tasks:** Parallel imaging in MRI, multi-coil reconstrution, SENSE reconstruction from scratch, g-factor for L2 regularized SENSE, g-factor maps, and GRAPPA reconstruction from scratch.

## Homework #5
- **Tasks:** Parallel imaging in MRI, L1-SPIRiT reconstruction from scratch, L1 regularization in Wavelet domain.
